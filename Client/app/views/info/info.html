  <h2>League Rules</h2>

  <h3>General Rules</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>League matches must be played using the assigned teams only.<br>
  Players cannot play ‘practice’ matches, friendlies or Ladder challenges with their assigned league teams, against an opponent in the same league, while the 2 players have outstanding league matches against each other to be played.</li>
</ul>

  <h3>Abandoned Matches</h3>
  <p>In the event of a match having to be abandoned the following guidelines can be used:

  <table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
    <thead>
      <tr>
          <td><h4>Minutes played</h4></td>
          <td><h4>Goal Difference</h4></td>
          <td><h4>Action</h4></td>
        </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>< 60</td>
      <td>N/A</td>
      <td>Replay</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60 - 80</td>
      <td>> 2</td>
      <td>Replay</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>60 - 80</td>
      <td><= 2</td>
      <td>Score stands</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>> 80</td>
      <td><= 1</td>
      <td>Replay</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>> 80</td>
      <td>> 1</td>
      <td>Score stands</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
  <br>
  Note that these are guidelines and common sense should be used (e.g. 5-0 after 58 mins… unlikely that a comeback is on) to make the final decision, preferably where both players agree. In the event of a disagreement, The 'Executive Committee' will make the final decision.</p>

  <h3>Standings</h3>
  <p>A player’s league position will be based on the following criteria (with respect to another player):

<ol>
  <li>Points (3 for a win, 1 for a draw)</li>
  <li>Goal Difference</li>
  <li>Goals Scored</li>
  <li>Head to Head points</li>
  <li>Goal difference in head to head matches</li>
  <li>Goals scored in head to head matches</li>
  <li>Away goals in head to head matches</li>
  <li>One-off match, with extra time and penalties if required</li>
</ol>
<br>
  Where 3 or more players are tied and criteria 1 to 7 above can provide sufficient differentiation, such that 2 players are left tied, a one-off match will be played between those two players for the upper position. In the event that there can be no differentiation found between all players involved, lots will be drawn.</p>

<h3>Promotion/Relegation</h3>
<p>The changes in league structure make it difficult to set out exact rules for promotions and relegations. However, in general, the league will look to achieve the following:

<ol>
  <li>One promotion place</li>
  <li>One relegation place</li>
  <li>One play-off spot (second bottom of upper league, second top of lower league).</li>
</ol>

<br>
The play-off will be played as a one-off match, with extra time and penalties if required. The winner will be given a place in the upper league, the loser will be given a place in the lower league.</p>
