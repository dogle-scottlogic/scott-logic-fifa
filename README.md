# Scott Logic - FIFA
This project is designed to track Xbox FIFA play within the Edinburgh office.

To set the project up locally:
* git clone the repo
* to make the server side work: open the Server project in Visual Studio and run it! that's it :)
* to make the client side work: go in the Client project and run 'npm install', 'bower install'
* to start up the client, navigate to the Client project and run 'grunt' in the console. This will start the node server.
If you navigate to http://localhost:3000 you should see our lovely landing page :)
